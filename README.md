# cg-scraper
very basic scraper for coin gecko

Scrapes data from the top 250 tokens on coin gecko. You can set it up to print whatever info you want from the names given in the structs, the current version is setup to divide the circulating supply by the total supply 

There is no error handling on this as it was created initially for a dydx bounty and modified for some simple personal uses

to run simply type cargo run or cargo run --release for the non debug version
